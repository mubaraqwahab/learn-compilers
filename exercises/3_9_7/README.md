# JSON Scanner

See [ECMA-404](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/) and [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) for JSON specifications.

This hand-made scanner works as a state machine, as described below. This description is similar to (and based on) the one given in [the specification of the HTML tokenizer](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#tokenization).

**Note:** The terms _scanner_, _lexer_, and _tokenizer_ are synonymous for our purposes.

## Tokens

TODO: What are the tokens and their properties?

## State machine

TODO: Don't forget special chars like EOF, whitespace, and escape sequences.
