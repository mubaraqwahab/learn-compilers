# Exercises

My attempts at the exercises in the textbook.

Directory `3_9_1` contains attempts at Exercise 3.9.1, and so on. (The reason for underscores instead of fullstops is to avoid path issues.)

Run TypeScript files with `npx ts-node path/to/ts/file`. Better yet, use Vitest to run tests: `npm test path/to/test/file`.
