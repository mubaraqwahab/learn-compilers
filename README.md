# Learn Compilers

Based on the book, [_Introduction to Compilers and Language Design_](http://compilerbook.org).

## Setup

1. You need to have these first:

   - [Node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - A C/C++ compiler (GCC or Clang) and Make
   - [AStyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html), a code formatter for C/C++. You can install this on Linux/Mac with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/astyle) (or google something like "ubuntu install astyle"). For Windows, download from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/).

   You can usually confirm that you have them by running `node --version`, `gcc --version`, etc.

2. Clone this repo and navigate into it.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mubaraqwahab/learn-compilers.git
   cd learn-compilers
   ```

3. Install JavaScript dependencies.

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. That's all.
