# Learn Compilers

My little tour of compiler design, based on the book, [_Introduction to Compilers and Language Design_](http://compilerbook.org).

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js v16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this repo and navigate into it:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mubaraqwahab/learn-compilers.git
   cd learn-compilers
   ```
3. Install JavaScript dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. That's all :-)
